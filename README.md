drawing balls from a hat but taking it further

calculates the probability that, given a set of different colors balls of different quantities, a smaller set (subset?) of different colored balls of different quantities will be drawn from the hat (i hope this explanation is correct)

e.g: given that there are 3 red balls, 6 green balls and 10 blue balls, what is the probability that 10 balls: 2 red balls, 2 green balls and 6 blue balls will be drawn from the hat?
